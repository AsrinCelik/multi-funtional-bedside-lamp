# multi-functional-bedside-lamp
WHAT İS THİS LAMP:
  This is a lamp that could show you date, humidity, temperature, clock and also it can close and open itself according to the light conditions of your room. You can change the light value, which enables the light to turn off in the light and turn on in the dark, from within the software. If you dont want to close light automatically, you can deactivate this feature.
  
  
NECESSARY MATERIALS:
- 1 Arduino Uno
- 1 LDR
- 1 10k ohm resistor
- 3 220 ohm resistor
- 1 IR receiver
- 1 IR remote control device
- 1 16*2 LCD screen (with I2C module)
- 1 DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor (If you want to measure conditions with higher accuracy you can use DHT21.)
- 1 RTC module
- 1 4 digit, 7 segment display. (I used TM1637.)
- RGB LEDs. (One of them will be used to show us is temperature high or low. Others will be used for just lighting.)
- 1 single color LED.

 
 I share fritzing file of this project also I will put there a screenshot to people who do not use fritzing.
